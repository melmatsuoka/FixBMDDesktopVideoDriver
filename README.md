# FixBMDDesktopVideoDriver
Simple AppleScript to fix issue with Blackmagic Desktop Video devices not being detected in macOS Big Sur.

You can use this to [create an Automator "Application"](https://eshop.macsales.com/blog/42196-macos-101-how-to-automate-tasks-on-your-mac/) that runs this AppleScript when you double click on it.

Thanks to user "tdawg_07" for publishing the command-line to reload the BlackmagicIO.kext
